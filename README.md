# SVAP
The Simulação de Volante no Arduino e Python (SVAP) make a simple connection between the PC and the games using arduino.  
This project was created to simulate a steering wheel (using keyboard logic) to play games.  
  
It has other fictures like autoclick keyboard or autoclick mouse with HUI suport.  
  
All the interactions with SVAP are in CMD!  
Becarfull with autoclicker it could become <span style="color:red"> unstable!</span>  
I made it to make the user do what ever you would like but even, so becarfull!

There are some abreviations of the commands.  
If you would like to explore or add new one just change the code as you would like!
